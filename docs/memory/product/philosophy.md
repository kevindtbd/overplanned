# Product / Philosophy

## Core Docs
- `docs/overplanned-philosophy.md` — Product voice, UX principles
- `docs/overplanned-philosophy-v2.md` — Updated philosophy

## Key Principles
- **Invisible intelligence** — ML shows in recommendation quality, never in UI displays
- **"Don't tell users what you think they are"** — never expose persona data directly
- **Behavioral, not demographic** — no age, home city, income profiling
- **Local-first signals** — Reddit, Tabelog, local forums. Not TripAdvisor/Yelp.
- **Utility framing, not surveillance** — "creepy" threshold on all features
- **No ML sauce on landing page** — don't reveal behavioral signals or pipeline

## Design Constraints (from philosophy)
- No emoji anywhere in the product
- No separate CSS/JS files — single-file components
- No localStorage in artifacts
- Decorative viz > informational viz

## Learnings
- Philosophy docs are design constraints, not just vibes — they kill features
