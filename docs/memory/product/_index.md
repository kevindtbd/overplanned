## Sub-topic Files
- `philosophy.md` — Product voice, UX principles, "invisible intelligence"

## Core Identity
Behavioral-driven travel recommendations, not demographic profiling.
Local intelligence (Reddit, Tabelog, local forums) + ML persona modeling.
Not TripAdvisor. Not Yelp. Local-first signals only.
