# UI / Group Trips

## Components
- `GroupDashboard.tsx` — Group overview
- `PulseLine.tsx` — Group activity pulse visualization
- `EnergyBars.tsx` — Member energy/engagement bars
- `AffinityMatrix.tsx` — Member compatibility display
- `VotePanel.tsx` — Async voting interface
- `CampDetector.tsx` — Camp/faction detection display
- `ConflictResolver.tsx` — Conflict resolution UI

## Design Rules
- Only positive features for group trips — no conflict detection framing in marketing
- Fairness engine: debt tracking + invisible rebalancing
- Abilene paradox detection ("not for me" dissent path)
- Subgroup split logic for large groups

## Learnings
- (space for future compound learnings)
